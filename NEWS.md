Version 0.2.0
=============

Added function simdata, which generates simulated rating scale data and
allows msd to be tested for accuracy.

Added the option to specify a wider range of possible rating categories
for functions pms and misfit than may be present in the data. This is
important because pms and misfit are useful for estimating person
measures and misfit statistics for individual persons, and it is
possible that the person did not use all rating categories.
